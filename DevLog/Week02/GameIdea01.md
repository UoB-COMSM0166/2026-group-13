# Game Idea 1: U help U

## Game Overview

This is a side‑scrolling level-based platformer where the player can record their actions and let a past version of themselves replay those actions. The core fun comes from cooperating with your past selves to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.

At its core, this is a stage‑based platformer. Players progress through the game one level at a time, with each level functioning as an independent challenge. After completing a stage, they simply move on to the next one.

## Core Mechanic: Record & Replay

The player has a limited number of recordings in each level.
After recording, a “past self” will appear and repeat the recorded actions, acting as a teammate.

Players must strategically use these past selves to complete each level.

## Key Level Mechanics

### 1. Stepping Stone

- A past self stands in a specific spot.

- The current player jumps on them to reach a higher platform

- Or uses past “bodies” to cross traps

- Or performs a double jump using a past self in mid‑air

*Why it’s fun:* Players must plan where their past self should stand.

### 2. Button Mechanisms

- Some doors or traps stay open only while a button is held

- A past self holds the button

- The current player passes through safely

*Why it’s fun:* Players must record a precise “button‑holding” action.

### 3. Cooperative Enemy Clearing

- flank enemies

- distract them

- perform synchronized attacks

- clear the entire map through coordinated timing

*Why it’s fun:* Players must plan timing, positioning, and cooperation between present and past selves.

### 4. Pushing Boxes Together

- Some boxes are too heavy for one person

- The current player and a past self push together

- Cooperation is required to move the box

*Why it’s fun:* Players must synchronize actions between present and past selves.

### 5. Movable Gift Box Start Point

Instead of spawning past selves at a fixed location, each recording begins from a gift box that the player can carry and position the gift box. This allows the player to choose exactly where the past self’s action sequence will begin.

By repositioning the gift box, players can:

- start a past self on a higher platform

- place them near a button, enemy, or puzzle element

- create more creative and strategic solutions

*Why it’s fun:* This mechanic gives players more control and freedom, turning the placement of the start point into part of the puzzle itself.

### 6. Loot Containers & Between‑Level Shop

#### Loot Containers ( Multiple containers are placed in each level, and players can open them during gameplay. Each container has a chance to drop ) :

- coins

- temporary power‑ups (shield, speed boost, one‑hit kill, etc.)

- ammo

#### Post‑Level Settlement :

- After completing a stage, all collected coins and rare items are converted into earnings.

#### Between‑Level Shop ( Players can spend their earnings to buy ) :

- stronger skills

- better weapons

- more ammo

### 7. Inverted World with Low Gravity

The mirrored space beneath the floor is defined as an **Inverted World**. To add variety, the Inverted World is set to a **low‑gravity environment**, where the player can jump twice as high and fall more slowly, enabling advanced movements impossible on the surface. The floor itself can be designed as a **semi‑transparent mirror barrier**, helping players visually distinguish between their past selves and their current character.

## Player Goal

- Each level provides a limited number of recordings

- Players must complete the level using only the help of their past selves

## Level Design Philosophy: One Mechanic per Level

Although the game includes multiple mechanics (such as pushing boxes, luring enemies, stepping on past selves, or holding buttons), ***each level focuses on only one mechanic at a time***, which:

- reduces difficulty

- keeps the learning curve smooth

- gives players a clear objective

- creates a sense of freshness, because every new level introduces a new idea or twist

Later levels can combine multiple mechanics, creating more complex and exciting challenges while still building on what the player has already learned.
