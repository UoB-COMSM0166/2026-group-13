# Degrees of Separation

## Core Details & Mechanics

### 1. Worldview  
Two parallel **fire–ice worlds**:  
- **Sunlit World** (warm, lush, fire-powered)  
- **Frosted World** (cold, snowy, ice-powered)  

They share the same geographical outline but have opposing ecosystems.

### 2. Core Mechanics  
- Split-screen **dual-character control**  
- Players manipulate:
  - **Eya** (Sunlit World)
  - **Kai** (Frosted World)  
- Abilities complement each other:
  - Fire melts ice walls  
  - Ice freezes lava  
- Actions in one world alter the other’s terrain  
- Both characters must reach their portals **simultaneously** to clear the level

### 3. Features  
- Minimal controls  
- No death mechanics  
- No complex stats  
- Focus on co-op gameplay

## Inspiration & Adaptation

### 1. Dual-World Logic  
- Adopt split-screen dual-world visualization  
- Replace fire–ice with **Normal World / Upside Down**

### 2. Cross-World Interaction  
- Actions in one world affect the other  
- Design interaction between:
  - Bulb collection (Normal World)
  - Monster fighting (Upside Down)

### 3. Co-op Emphasis  
- Reference “dual simultaneous goals”  
- Both players must cooperate to clear levels
