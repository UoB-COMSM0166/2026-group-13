## Epics and User Stories

### **Part one: Players**
1. **高玩**：
2. **菜鸟/新手**：
3. **Potential Player - Accessible Gameplay and Seamless Experience**
- **Visual Hook** - As a potential player looking for a new game, I want to see a vibrant and dynamic cover art, so that my curiosity is sparked and I am encouraged to click through. The color scheme of the cover art must remain consistent with the in-game UI to create a unified brand identity.
- **Catchy Title and Slogan** - As a potential player, I want to see a unique, memorable game title and a concise gameplay description, so that I can instantly understand what makes this game unique. Must include a "Hook Line" (under 20 words) that highlights the core challenge (e.g., "The ultimate one-life challenge").
- **Superior Game Performance** - As a potential player, I want the game to load quickly within the p5.js web environment, so that I don't lose interest due to long wait times. When running on mainstream browsers (Chrome/Edge), the frame rate (FPS) must remain stable at approximately 60 FPS.
4. **职业玩家**：

### **Part two: Designers设计师**

### **Part three: Developer(Coder) - Robust Game Framework & Debugging System**
- **Code Modularity** - As a coder, I want to build a class-based modular entity system, so that I can add new enemies or power-ups without breaking the existing logic. All game objects (e.g., Player, Enemy) must be encapsulated in separate .js files and invoked by the main script.
- **Real-time Debugging Tools** - As a coder, I want a toggleable "Debug Mode" that displays hitboxes, so that I can precisely fine-tune the physical collision logic. When Debug Mode is active, the console must output the player's current coordinates (x, y) in real-time.

### **Part four: Designers设计师**
