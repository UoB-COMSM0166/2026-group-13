## Epics and User Stories

### **Part One: Players**
1. **高玩**：
2. **菜鸟/新手**：
3. **Potential Player - Accessible Gameplay and Seamless Experience**
- **Visual Hook** - As a potential player looking for a new game, I want to see a vibrant and dynamic cover art, so that my curiosity is sparked and I am encouraged to click through. The color scheme of the cover art must remain consistent with the in-game UI to create a unified brand identity.
- **Catchy Title and Slogan** - As a potential player, I want to see a unique, memorable game title and a concise gameplay description, so that I can instantly understand what makes this game unique. Must include a "Hook Line" (under 20 words) that highlights the core challenge (e.g., "The ultimate one-life challenge").
- **Superior Game Performance** - As a potential player, I want the game to load quickly within the p5.js web environment, so that I don't lose interest due to long wait times. When running on mainstream browsers (Chrome/Edge), the frame rate (FPS) must remain stable at approximately 60 FPS.
4. **职业玩家**：
5. **Normal Player**：  
- **Technical Implementation & Stability** - As a normal player, I want the game to run smoothly without lag or unexpected crashes, so that I can focus on gameplay rather than technical issues.  
- **Game Balance & Difficulty Adjustment** - As a normal player, I want the game difficulty to increase smoothly over time (not in sudden spikes),so that the challenge feels fair and I stay motivated to continue playing.

### **Part Two: Designers设计师**

### **Part Three: Developer(Coder) - Robust Game Framework & Debugging System**
- **Code Modularity** - As a coder, I want to build a class-based modular entity system, so that I can add new enemies or power-ups without breaking the existing logic. All game objects (e.g., Player, Enemy) must be encapsulated in separate .js files and invoked by the main script.
- **Real-time Debugging Tools** - As a coder, I want a toggleable "Debug Mode" that displays hitboxes, so that I can precisely fine-tune the physical collision logic. When Debug Mode is active, the console must output the player's current coordinates (x, y) in real-time.

### **Part Four: Designers设计师**

### **Part Five: lecturer TA讲师/助教（课程授课教师）**

### **Part Six: 竞争对手**

### **Part Seven: 社区成员**

### **Part Eight: software engineering 本课程及学院**

### **Part Nine: platform平台：p5js**  
- **Technical Implementation & Stability** - As the p5.js platform, I want the game logic and rendering to be implemented efficiently within the p5.js framework, so that the game can run reliably in a web browser environment.
- **Game Balance & Difficulty Adjustment** - As the p5.js platform, I want game difficulty to be controlled through adjustable parameters (e.g., movement speed, obstacle frequency, timing limits), so that balance changes can be made without rewriting core game logic.

### **Part Ten: 市场相关人员**
