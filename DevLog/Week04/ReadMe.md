## Epics and User Stories

### **Players**
#### pro player
* **Hidden Easter Eggs & Secret Challenges** - As a hardcore player, I hope levels hide in-depth secret content (e.g., "reverse time-space" mechanics, secret passages requiring 10+ recording segments for collaboration). This lets me repeatedly explore, deconstruct rules, and unlock exclusive achievements and the "Time-Space Master" title, gaining a sense of exclusive honor.

* **Extreme Difficulty Levels & Global Leaderboards** - As a hardcore player, I crave ultra-hardcore levels (no hints, complex nested terrain, millisecond-precision action prediction) paired with real-time global leaderboards. This allows me to compete with top players worldwide in clear time and recording counts, striving for the "optimal solution" throne to showcase my dual prowess in skill and strategy.

* **Unlimited Multi-Segment Recording & Chain Collaboration** - As a hardcore player, I want the game to lift recording limits and support the coexistence of multiple "Past Selves." This way, I can design "time-space chain strategies" (e.g., three versions of myself from different timelines laying the groundwork and assisting in relay) to overcome extreme terrain and savor the thrill of meticulous planning.

* **Custom Level Editor & Community Competition** - As a hardcore player, I want a fully functional level editor (custom terrain, platforms, checkpoints) that supports uploading and sharing user-created levels. This enables me to craft ultra-difficult challenge maps, compete with fellow hardcore players in the community, and extend the game's lifespan indefinitely through shared puzzle-solving ideas.

## Reflection

在我们推进游戏进度时，团队将史诗、用户故事和验收标准应用于我们的“录制与回放”机制构建的横版卷轴平台闯关挑战游戏，并对于作为实用的需求工程工具而非抽象的文档练习有了更清晰的理解。

在史诗级故事层面，我们学习了如何将整体设计意图转化为指导开发决策的战略目标。它帮助我们设定了诸如易于上手的新手引导、低挫败感的游戏体验以及机制驱动的创造力等目标。这些宏观主题确保了各个功能始终与整体玩家体验保持一致，而不是孤立地实现。例如，定义“零挫折、短周期”这一史诗，确保即使在设计像“颠倒世界”这样复杂的关卡时，我们的开发重点也能始终与“最小操作 与 最大巧妙性”的核心愿景保持一致。

用户故事则将我们的关注点从机制设计转移到了体验设计。通过应用“作为玩家，我想要……，以便……”的格式，我们将诸如记录玩家操作或限制回放次数等技术概念重新定义为以玩家为中心的动机，例如清晰度、满足感和巧妙解决问题的成就感。这种方法还帮助我们区分新手玩家、经验丰富的玩家和评估人员，从而使我们能够在早期阶段优先考虑可用性和学习曲线。例如，我们没有简单地编写克隆功能，而是定义了：“作为玩家，我希望利用我的‘过去自我’作为垫脚石，以便到达更高的平台”。这明确了克隆机制的实际游戏价值。

最后，验收标准为我们提供了必要的约束与技术严谨性，使我们的想法可测试且可实现。通过使用 Given-When-Then 结构，我们定义了清晰时间循环逻辑的可测试结果。例如：“给定录制阶段结束，当回放阶段开始时，‘过去的自己’实体必须执行与录制输入完全相同的顺序。” 将抽象的谜题构想转化为客观、可测试的需求，有效地防止了范围蔓延，并确保创意在 p5.js 环境下保持技术可行性。

总而言之，这项实践表明，需求方法并非对创造力的限制，而是帮助我们将复杂的游戏创意转化为连贯、可玩且具有真正用户价值的系统框架。
